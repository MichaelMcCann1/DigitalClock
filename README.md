# DigitalClock

I created a clock that is styled like an old digital clock you might find on a nightstand. The clock shows the current time, whether it is AM or PM, and the date. 

The numbers for the time are styled not a font, instead they are div elements. Each line segment is a div element and the correct elements are changed to a red color for each digit. This effect creates the appearance of a number.

This clock was made using vanilla JavaScript and was styled using scss.
