# DigitalClock

I created a clock that is styled like an old digital clock you might find on a nightstand. The clock shows the current time, whether it is AM or PM, and the date. 

The numbers for the time are not from a font. Each line segment in a digit is a div element and the correct elements are changed to a red color for the appropriate number. This effect creates the appearance of a number like old digital clocks.

This clock was made using vanilla JavaScript and was styled using scss.
